# stock-analysis

# Overview of Project
##### For this project, we have created a VBA program to analyze a stock's annual returns. We have been given a list of tickers and daily price action data. The goal is to provide an easy visual comparison of the percentage gains for each ticker. Past performance is not necessarily an indication of future results.


# Results
##### We can now compare the results of the 2017 data with that of 2018. Wheras the annual returns of 2017 was positive for almost all stocks, the annual returns of 2018 are deeply negative for almost all stocks. The only stock that had outsized returns in both 2017 and 2018 was ticker symbol ENPH, enphase energy. In terms of runtime, the refactored code ran considerably faster for both years:

# Summary
##### Refactoring code is an essential part of the programming process that requires a solid grasp of how the original code works.

##### The code for this project ran much faster because instead of looping through the data multiple times, the refactored code only loops through it once and obtains all the necessary information.
